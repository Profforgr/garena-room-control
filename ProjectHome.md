Garena Room Control (grc) is heavily based on GCB by uakf.b which can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/gcb/

The goal for grc is to give channel admins complete control over each of the rooms they control and to automate some tedious processes such as recording and retrieving ban information.

Suggestions are most welcome, PM GG.Dragon through fairplay forums.
